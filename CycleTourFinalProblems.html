<H3> The Dataset</H3>
You will be asked a series of questions. Each of them describes a
traveller, Andy or Amy,
who follows a specified route and returns to their original starting point.
The question you have to answer is, what is the <em>signed area</em> of the
region that his path encloses, in square miles? The signed area enclosed by a path
is positive if the path is counterclockwise and negative if the path is clockwise.
In all the questions the path will either be clearly clockwise or clearly
counterclockwise; we will not have questions where the route crosses itself.
You need not explain your answers; just give the numerical value.

<p>
A few examples to make this clear:
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Andy starts at the point where Colorado meets Oklahoma and 
Kansas. He travels north along the entire eastern border of Colorado, 
west along its entire northern border, south along its entire western border, 
and east along its entire southern border. What is the signed area enclosed
by the path? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> 104,094 square miles. <br>
<b>Explanation:</b>The path contains the state of Colorado
and is counterclockwise. 
<p>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> Amy starts at the point where Colorado meets Oklahoma and 
Kansas. She travels west along the entire southern border of Colorado, 
north along its entire western border, east along its entire northern border, 
and south along its entire eastern border. 
What is the signed area enclosed by the path? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> -104,094 square miles. <br>
<b>Explanation:</b>The path contains the state of Colorado
and is clockwise. 


<P>
<b>Question:</b> Amy starts at the southeast corner of Arkansas. 
She travels 
upstream on the Mississippi River until she reaches Iowa. She travels due
west on the southern border of Iowa until she reaches Nebraska. She travels
south on the eastern borders of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas to
the northwest corner of Louisiana. She travels east along the northern border
of Louisiana until she returns to her starting point.
What is the signed area enclosed by the path? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> 121,894 square miles.
<b>Explanation:</b> 
The path is counterclockwise and encloses Arkansas (52179 sq. miles) and Missouri
(69715 sq. miles).

<p> In all of the problems in the dataset, the path completely 
encloses some number of US states and some countries in Europe, Asia, and 
Africa.
Therefore  the problem can be solved
can be solved
by (i) figuring out what regions are enclosed; (ii) looking up their areas; 
(iii) adding those
up; and (iv) figuring out whether the path is clockwise or counterclockwise to
get the sign.

<p>
The relevant areas of the states and countries are their land areas plus
their inland waters, but not including their coastal waters.
For US states,
that sum can be computed by adding the "Land area" and "Inland water are"
columns in 
<A href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-wet-your-state-water-area-each-state"> 
this table.</A> (For states not on the coast or on the Great Lakes, that is
just the total area.)
For countries, the sum can be found in
<A href="https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/ag.srf.totl.k2/rankings/"> 
this table.</A>. For Canadian provinces, that  is the total area as listed 
in 
<A href="https://www.worldatlas.com/geography/canadian-provinces-and-territories-by-size.html"> here</A>

<p>
Paths that go up the Atlantic coast of North Carolina should be 
assumed to travel up the Outer Banks. The area of North Carolina may thus be taken 
as 52,670 square miles (48618 land plus 4052 inland water). 

<p> 
The area of Saskatchewan
may be taken as 651,036 square kilometers, which is the figure given both in
the table linked above and in the Wikipedia article "Geography of Saskatchewan". 
(The Wikipedia article "Saskatchewan" gives an area of 651,900 square kilometers.)
Due to surveying errors in the 1880s the Saskatchewan/Alberta border does not lie
perfectly on a line of longitude, and
meeting point of Saskatchewan, Alberta,
and Northwest Territories is in fact 400 meters west of the meeting point of Alberta,
Nunavut, and Northwest Territories. Ignore both those fact, and assume that the 
border runs north/south and that four
regions in fact meet at a single point, as it would appear from looking at a large
scale map.

<p> South Sudan and Western Sahara are not included in the 
list of countries linked above. South Sudan has has an area of 644,329 
square kilometers. Western Sahara has an area of 272,000 square kilometers. The
figure given there for Serbia 88,360 sq. km. includes both Serbia and Kosovo.
Kosovo has an area of 10887; Serbia without Kosovo has an area of 77,589.
Kaliningrad (a disconnected part of Russia) has an area of 15215 square 
kilometers.

<p>
For paths in Europe that include the continental part of 
Italy, use a figure of 252,150 km<sup>2</sup> = 97330 mi<sup>2</sup>
(302,700 for the country of Italy minus Sicily (25,830) and Sardinia (24,090)).
For path that include the continental part of France, 
, use a figure of 535,220 km<sup>2</sup> = 206,600 mi<sup>2</sup>
(535,940 for European France minus Corsica (8722)). There remains some
imprecision &mdash; there are other small islands, it makes some difference
exactly what path you follow in travelling along rivers, there is a 26 square
mile chunck of Kentucky that is west of the Mississippi river, and so on.
For that reason, an answer that agrees with ours to within 1% will be 
considered correct.
<p>
I suggest that you get a map and draw the route on the map. (If you are using a 
printed map it might be a good idea to use tracing paper, so as not
to spoil the map. Or make photocopies.) Once you've done that, the answers to
(i) and (iv) should be visually obvious.

<p>
Any simple closed cycle C on a plane divides the plane into 
two disconnected parts: The inside
and the outside (mathematically, this is known as "the Jordan curve theorem"). Any 
simple closed cycle on the surface of the sphere divides the sphere into two 
parts. Unless
the cycle has a size comparable to the circumference of the earth, one part will be
much smaller in area than the other; the small part is the "inside" and the 
large part is the "outside". The way you can tell whether a point X is inside or 
outside C is this: Pick some point P very far from C (in all our examples, P could
be the North Pole, for example. Is there a some kind of path, possibly very twisty,
from X to P that never comes in contact with C? If there is such a path, then X
is outside C. If it is impossible to get from X to P without crossing C, then X is 
inside C.

<p>
Here's a method for determining whether a complicated cycle is clockwise or 
counterclockwise, which works as long as you can tell what is inside and what
is outside. Imagine that the traveller is always facing forward on the path that 
they are traversing. If the cycle is clockwise, than the stuff immediately to their
right is inside the cycle and the stuff to their left is outside. If the cycle
is counterclockwise, then the stuff to their right is outside and the stuff to their
left is inside.

<p> Another way to judge clockwise vs. counterclockwise is to look for the
extreme parts of the path in each of the cardinal directions. 
If the path
is clockwise, then the northmost part of the path goes east, the 
eastmost goes south, the southmost goes west, and the westmost goes north.
If the path
is counter-clockwise, then the southmost part of the path goes east, the 
eastmost goes north, the northmost goes west, and the westmost goes south.

<p>
At no time does the traveller turn completely around and retrace his steps 
on the route he has just taken in the opposite direction. Please keep this
in mind, as it can be critical in disambiguating the path taken. For
instance I might write, "Amy starts at the northeast corner of
Colorado and travels due west to the northwest corner. 
She then continues on the border of Wyoming until she reaches Nebraska."
The first sentence means that Amy travels west along the northern border
of Colorado with Nebraska and then on the northern border of Colorado  
with Wyoming to the northwest corner of Colorado.
Since Amy is not allowed to turn around,
the second sentence, "she continues on the border of Wyoming," means that she
continues travelling west on the southern border of Wyoming with Utah, then 
goes north on the western border of Wyoming with Utah, Idaho and 
(briefly) Montana; then west on the northern border of Wyoming with Montana;
then south on the eastern border of Wyoming with South Dakota until she
reaches the meeting point of Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nebraska. (You
might like to look at a map.)

<p>
Some of these paths would in reality be physically extremely difficult 
or impossible.  Some of the paths that go along borders of countries 
would put a traveller at risk
of being arrested by border patrols on one side or the other. Ignore
all such practical considerations. The question is really about the 
area inside a curve that can be drawn on a map.

<p>
If you feel that a question is flawed --- that is, the path described is 
impossible, or the path is not a simple closed curve, or that the description is 
consistent with two 
different valid paths with significantly different answers --- then you should
answer "Flawed". If you want, you may explain the flaw, but that is not required.
No flawed examples have been included deliberately, but it is 
certainly possible that a mistake has been made. If you are correct that the
problem is flawed, then an answer of "Flawed" will be marked correct; if
in fact the problem is not flawed, then the answer will be marked incorrect.
Small misspellings, grammatical errors, or punctuation errors do not count 
as flaws for this purpose.

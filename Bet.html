 On February 10, 2025 I proposed the following bet on Facebook:

    For those who feel it is likely that AGI is imminent: I will bet $200 even odds, that I can, in the next six weeks, assemble a dataset of 100 problems written entirely in English text (no images) with numerical answers that a smart sixth-grader using standard references and an adding machine can easily and reliably answer, and that no AI that exists on December 31, 2025 can get more than 25 out of 100 correct. I'll offer the same bet at $100 to $200 for December 31, 2026.

   The terms are: On or before March 24, I will finalize the collection and save it in a way that the date of the version can be authenticated (possibly just by emailing it to a trusted third party). If anyone accepts the bet, then I will release the dataset on January 2, 2026/7. They get to try 4 different AI programs, of their choice, by January 8. The dataset has to be given directly to the program as I have written it; they may not add prompts, write preprocessing code, etc. between the release and the test. The onus of getting access to the programs is up to them (e.g. if GPT-7q has been announced with all kinds of wonderful claims but the better can't actually run it, then its existence doesn't affect the bet.)

    Until someone accepts the bet, I will feel free to either change the terms of the bet (odds or date) or withdraw it entirely if I feel that circumstances warrant it. 

I added a couple of clarifying comments before the bet was accepted:

    Any pre-existing computer program using any kind of resource other than consulting with a human being [is allowed]. What is disallowed is rigging up some kind of combination once you've seen the dataset. If you want to create a setup that calls GPT-5 + [AlphaGeometry 3 + AlphaProof 2] before 12/31/25, and you don't change it, that's fine. 

Itamar Talmon accepted the bet on Facebook on February 11.
